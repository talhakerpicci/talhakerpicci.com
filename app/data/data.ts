    fullBio: `
    Hey there! My name is Talha Kerpicci. I'm currently working at Borda Technology as a Flutter Developer.
    <br><br>
    I started my programming career with C# and gained experience in development of various desktop applications. In addition to that I had some experience in Unity Game Engine.
    <br><br>
    Apart from these, I started learning Python and dived into web scraping. I created some tools for myself which I have been still using in my daily life.
    <br><br>
    Moreover, I have been learning Flutter to develop mobile applications for the last few months. I'm currently working on Simple Library.
    <br><br>
    I also have a huge interest on Linux and open source community. I am very enthusiastic to learn novelties in programming and Linux!
